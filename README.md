# phase1_aviation_risk_analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 to help the company make informed decisions about aircraft investment. By identifying accident trends, injury patterns, and risk factors, the analysis reduces uncertainty in entering the aviation industry and supports safer, more strategic decisions.

## Business Understanding

**Problem Statement:**  
The company plans to purchase and operate aircraft for commercial and private use but lacks knowledge about historical safety risks. Investing in high-risk aircraft could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, or regulatory issues.

**Objectives:**  
- Identify aircraft types with the lowest historical accident rates.  
- Analyze trends in aviation accidents over time.  
- Evaluate factors contributing to higher accident risk.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for safer aircraft investment decisions.  

## Data Understanding
- Data sourced from the **National Transportation Safety Board (1962–2023)**.  
- Includes accident details, aircraft information, injuries, investigation types, and operational data.  
- Data cleaning steps included: handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing incorrect date entries, and converting relevant columns to categorical or numerical types.  

## Visualizations
The analysis is supported by three key visualizations (also included in the presentation):  
1. **Accidents by Phase of Flight** – Highlights when accidents are most likely to occur (e.g., takeoff, landing).  
2. **Top 10 Aircraft Makes in Accidents** – Identifies manufacturers most frequently involved in accidents.  
3. **Total Injuries per Year** – Shows long-term trends in accident severity.

## Conclusion
- Certain aircraft types show consistently lower accident and fatality rates.  
- Takeoff, landing, and approach are the riskiest phases of flight.  
- Accident and injury trends reveal long-term safety improvements.  
- Avoiding historically high-risk aircraft is critical to safer investments.
